# Pendragon-Tweaks

A small collection of conveniences (in my opinion) for running Pendragon 6e on FoundryVTT.

## What are the tweaks?

Currently, the following things have been added, removed, or altered:

-   A status is automatically added to tokens/actors when a horse is "equipped".
-   Added a disarmed status that can be managed by the players or GM.
-   Optionally filters out many of the default status effects from Foundry.

More to come as I find things I need while running my Pendragon game.
