# Pendragon-Tweaks

A small collection of conveniences (in my opinion) for running Pendragon 6e on FoundryVTT.

## What are the tweaks?

Currently, the following things have been added, removed, or altered:

-   A status is automatically added to tokens/actors when a horse is "equipped".
-   A flag called "geniality" has been added to actors for tracking with the feast system.
    -   You will probably need another mod to view and modify this flag, such as _Bar Brawl_.
